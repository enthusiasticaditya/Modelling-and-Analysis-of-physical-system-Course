# Modelling-and-Analysis-of-physical-system-Course
# Simulation of Physical Systems
Simulated various physical systems using MATLAB and applied Freefem++ for solving fluid flow and diffusion problems using numerical methods such as CSFT and CSCT in finite difference. Accurately modeled systems and solved complex physical problems through numerical techniques.

# Skills Used: MATLAB, Freefem++, numerical methods, finite difference techniques.
